### Welcome, fellow coder!
I'm Philipp, enthusiastic python and Android/kotlin developer with a background in neuroscience and AI.

Currently, I'm the CEO and lead Android developer at @eye2you where we make retina examinations faster, cheaper, and more accessible by combining mobile devices and artificial intelligence.

My expertise is in machine learning / artificial intelligence for image and video processing. But I'm also interested in other fields of machine learning and AI, especially with mobile applications or so-called AI-on-edge. 

My current personal project uses machine learning in transportation, and will be available in 2023. Stay tuned :-).
